# BIOSENSE
"BioSense" emerges as a revolutionary application, where the title suggests a combination of "bio," likely referring to biodegradable materials, and "sense," indicating detection or awareness
The proposed application development project aims to classify biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste using Machine Learning and image recognition.
This innovative app is designed to automatically categorize and segregate waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable components, thereby contributing to efficient recycling practices and reducing environmental impact.
